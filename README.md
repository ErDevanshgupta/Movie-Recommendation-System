# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation system designed to offer personalized movie suggestions to users based on their preferences. It utilizes Python and scikit-learn to analyze movie data from the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset and recommend similar movies.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, recommendation systems play a crucial role in helping users discover new content. This movie recommendation system aims to enhance user experience by suggesting movies tailored to their tastes. By analyzing movie features such as title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew, the system provides relevant and engaging movie recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two main CSV files:

- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: This file contains detailed information about various movies, including their titles, overviews, genres, keywords, and more.
- **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: This file contains credit details for each movie, including information about the cast and crew involved in its production.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Integration**: The two datasets are merged based on the movie titles to create a unified dataframe for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Relevant features such as movie ID, title, overview, genres, keywords, cast, and crew are selected for further processing.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Any missing values are handled, and unnecessary columns are removed to ensure data integrity.
4. **Text Processing**: Textual data such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew are processed to prepare them for analysis.

## Feature Engineering

- **Text Vectorization**: The textual data is transformed into numerical representations using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn. This converts the textual features into a bag-of-words representation, which is suitable for analysis.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Cosine similarity is calculated between movies based on their textual features. This metric measures the similarity between two movies, allowing for the identification of similar movies within the dataset.

## Recommendation Algorithm

This movie recommendation system employs a content-based filtering approach. Given a movie title as input, the system identifies similar movies based on their textual features. It then recommends the top 5 most similar movies to the user, providing personalized movie suggestions.

## Usage

To use the movie recommendation system:

1. Run the provided Python script (`movie_recommendation_system.py`) to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate recommendations.
2. Input a movie title to the `recommend()` function within the script to receive personalized movie recommendations.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10.4
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Files

- **movie_recommendation_system.py**: Python script containing the implementation of the recommendation system.
- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Dataset containing movie information.
- **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: Dataset containing movie credits information.
- **movie_list.pkl**: Pickle file containing the preprocessed movie data.
- **similarity.pkl**: Pickle file containing the similarity matrix generated by the system.
